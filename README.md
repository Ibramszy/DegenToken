# Degen Gaming Token ðŸŽ®

Welcome to the Degen Gaming Token project! This document provides an overview of the token's functionality and deployment instructions for Degen Gaming, a renowned game studio looking to enhance player engagement with a unique `ERC20` token on the Avalanche blockchain.

## Overview

The DegenToken contract is designed for Degen Gaming to enhance player engagement by allowing players to earn, transfer, redeem, and burn tokens within the Avalanche blockchain ecosystem.

## Key Features and Code Functionality

`Minting New Tokens`: Only the owner can mint new tokens to reward players.
`Transferring Tokens`: Players can transfer their tokens to other players.
`Redeeming Tokens`: Players can redeem tokens for in-game items.
`Checking Token Balance`: Players can view their current token balance.
`Burning Tokens`: Players can burn their own tokens when they are no longer needed.

## Technical Details

The token is an ERC20 compliant token deployed on the Avalanche blockchain. Below are the core functionalities of the token smart contract:

1. Minting New Tokens
   ```solidity
   function mintTokens(address to, uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {
     _mint(to, amount);
   }
   ```
   The mintTokens function lets only the owner mint new tokens. This is enforced by the onlyOwner modifier from the Ownable contract.

2. Transferring Tokens
   ```solidity
    function transferTokens(address to, uint256 amount) public {
        require(to != address(0), "Invalid address");
        require(balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amount, "Not enough tokens to transfer");
        _transfer(msg.sender, to, amount);
    }
   ```
   The transferTokens function allows players to transfer tokens to other addresses. It checks for sufficient balance and valid recipient address.

3. Redeeming Tokens
   ```solidity
    function redeemGamePad(uint256 quantity) public {
        uint256 cost = REDEMPTION_RATE * quantity;
        require(balanceOf(msg.sender) >= cost, "Not enough tokens");

        gamePadOwned[msg.sender] += quantity;
        _burn(msg.sender, cost);
    }
   ```
   The redeemGamePad function allows players to redeem tokens for in-game items, tracked by the gamePadOwned mapping. The cost of redemption is calculated using a constant REDEMPTION_RATE.

4. Checking Token Balance
   ```solidity
    function checkTokenBalance(address account) public view returns (uint256) {
        return balanceOf(account);
    }
   ```
   The checkTokenBalance function allows players to view their token balance.

5. Burning Tokens
   ```solidity
    function burnTokens(uint256 amount) public {
        require(balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amount, "Not enough tokens to burn");
        _burn(msg.sender, amount);
    }
   ```
   The burnTokens function allows players to burn their own tokens.

### Constructor
The constructor sets the token name and symbol and mints 10 tokens to the deployerâ€™s address.
```solidity
constructor() ERC20("Degen", "DGN") Ownable(msg.sender) {
    mintTokens(msg.sender, 10 * (10 ** uint256(decimals())));
}
```
